# InsultGenerator

The Insult Generator is an Android App that creates randomized insults using built-in wordbanks of preset words and phrases. Insults are generated when word banks are chosen and the user presses the "Generate" button. Insults can also be autogenerated after regular intervals of time, specified by the user. The autogenerator, when running, persists when app is minimized, posting newly generated insults into the status bar notification. The autogenerator is a foreground service, and when running cannot be destroyed by the Android OS nor can its push notification be dismissed, until the autogenerator is stopped. The generator also has the ability to autocopy insults to the clipboard, allowing for easy pasting of insults. This can be used in conjunction with the autogenerator to allow for regularly randomized insults to be pasted whilst the user is in another application.

Word banks are divided into categories, including:
