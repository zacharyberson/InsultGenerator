# Insult Generator

The Insult Generator is a fun Android App that creates silly, randomized insults using built-in word banks of preset words and phrases. Currently implemented is the Shakespearean work bank, carefully crafted using phrases and grammar from his many works. The app does not contain nor is intended to contain any possibly offensive expletives.

Insults are generated when word banks are chosen and the user presses the "Generate" button. They can also be auto-generated after regular intervals of time, specified by the user. Options include manually or automatically copying insults to the clipboard, allowing the user to easily paste them in any text box.

The auto-generator has the ability to continue in the background so silly insults are always readily available. Once started, it persists even when the app is minimized, posting newly generated insults into the status bar notification until the "stop" button is pressed. This can be used in conjunction with the option to copy insults to the clipboard automatically, allowing for regularly randomized insults to be pasted whilst the user is in another application.

Currently only the Shakespeare word bank is implemented. There are plans to add more word banks in the future, including a "Pirate" word bank.
